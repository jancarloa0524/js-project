# The Plan

The first step for me was to create a working prototype of the Tip Calculator. Once I have that, I'll incorporate any other code I need. 
The following is a checklist that I will follow as I make my project:

1. plan.md written? __Done!__
2. prototype created? __Done!__
3. Incorporated the following requruirements? __Need to do...__
    * prompt __Done!__
