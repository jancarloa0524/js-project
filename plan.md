# The Plan

The first step for me was to create a working prototype of the Tip Calculator. Once I have that, I'll incorporate any other code I need. 
The following is a checklist that I will follow as I make my project:

1. plan.md written? _Done!_
2. prototype created? _Done!_
3. Incorporated the following requruirements? _Need to do..._
    * prompt _Done!_
    * alert _Done!_
    * document.write() _Done!_
    * string concantenation _Done!_
    * array _Done!_
    * function parameter _Done!_
    * function return _Done!_
    * conditional _Done!_
    * COMMENTS!!! _Done_
    * While loop (EC) _Done!_
4. Need to fix...
    * Value does not return properly (i.e. $50, 2%, 2 people, returns $25.5) _Need to do..._
    * If the user only inputs 1 person, the document.write should reflect that _Done..._
    * If the user does  not input a positive integer for each, the calculator should reflect that _Need to do..._
