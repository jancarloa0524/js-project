# The Plan

The first step for me was to create a working prototype of the Tip Calculator. Once I have that, I'll incorporate any other code I need. 
The following is a checklist that I will follow as I make my project:

1. plan.md written? _Done!_
2. prototype created? _Done!_
3. Incorporated the following requruirements? _Need to do..._
    * prompt _Done!_
    * alert _Need to do..._
    * document.write() __Done!_
    * string concantenation _Done!_
    * array _Need to do..._
    * function parameter _Done!__
    * function return __Need to do..._
    * conditional _Need to do..._
    * COMMENTS!!! _Need to do..._
    * While loop (EC) _Need to do..._
4. Need to fix...
    * Value does not return properly (i.e. $50, 2%, 2 people, returns $25.5) _Need to do..._
